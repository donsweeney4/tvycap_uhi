 the app is not coming from the Google Play Store, tyou must give their phone permission to install it. The EAS webpage makes this easy.

Here is what to do on the Android phone:

Open the Link on the phone's web browser (like Chrome).

Tap "Install": The webpage will show your app icon and an "Install" button. Tap it.

See the Security Warning: The phone will immediately show a pop-up that says something like:

"For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source."

Grant Permission:

The pop-up will have a "Settings" button. Tap it.

It will take you directly to a settings page for the browser (e.g., "Install unknown apps > Chrome").

You just need to flip the switch to "Allow from this source."

Install the App:

Tap the "Back" button to return to the browser.

A new pop-up will appear that says "Do you want to install this application?"

Tap "Install," and the app will install and be added to their app drawer.

You can then find the app icon in the app drawer (by swiping up from their home screen) and drag it to the main screen.
